TITLE		: HIFI_THATTU_KADA
DEVELOPER	: SIVA ANAND K S
TOOLS USED	: Spring Boot, gradle, war package, apache in build server, github repository, postgre sql, hibernate.

Work Flow:

	1. 	We have a file name application.java with the main method. 
	2. 	As 	we know all know web application don't need main method, the spring boot changed it.
	3.	simply saying, when running the .war file, the main method is getting started.
	4. 	since we have the @ComponentScan annotation + gradle it scans all the packages, and observes all the configuration file while starting the server.
	5.	in out project we have the configuration file name HibernateConfiguration.java, In this file we configure all the necessary beans, creating session, configuring view resolvers,hibernation configuration etc.. all done here
	6. 	since we configured view resolver, prefix and suffix, it will automatically search for the index.jsp file in /WEB-INF/jsp/
	7. 	so, thats how we are seeing index.jsp in the url, localhost:8080/hifi_thattu_kada/
